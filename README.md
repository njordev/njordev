👋 Hi, I'm @njordev!

👀 I'm a creative individual with a focus on product videos. I work primarily with Blender and have a strong interest in 3D modeling and animation.

🌱 At the moment, I'm broadening my skills by learning to program. I'm always ready for new challenges and look forward to advancing in this new field.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on exciting projects, especially if they involve 3D modeling, animation, or programming.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me through my GitHub for any potential collaborations or to chat about our shared interests. I'm always open to connecting with others in the community.
